Unit/API tests inject controlled fixtures to prove failure paths. The headed live test uses real observations and an isolated PostgreSQL engine. Neither substitutes for an actual Supabase-hosted end-to-end deployment test.

## Requires your accounts / environment

- Apply schema to a real Supabase project and configure its server-only credentials.
- Start the normal server against Supabase; track an actual search result; verify initial/history/log rows through that connection.
- Build/run the Docker image on Render. Docker is not installed here, so the Linux container/runtime has not been executed locally.
- Deploy Vercel, set its build-time API URL, verify deployed CORS and deep-link routing.
- Configure cron-job.org, test authenticated enqueue and job status, and observe an actual two-hour scheduled cycle.
- Record the normal headed CLI against your Supabase project so its attempts appear in your dashboard.
- Add real deployment, repository, recording links and screenshots to README.

The hosted workflow is not marked complete until these are verified. The final application never auto-seeds the observed values or uses a mock database when credentials are absent.
